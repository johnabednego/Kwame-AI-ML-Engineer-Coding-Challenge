And authenticity is a precondition precedent to admissibility of a writing. Section 136 of the Evidence Act, NRCD 323. See also the case of JUXON-SMITH v KLM DUTCH AIRLINES \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 438; where the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal to exclude four vital documents admitted by the trial Judge as the precondition necessary for their admissibility had been violated, thus sinning against section 136 of NRCD 323. Rather than rule that Ex ‘C’ was wrongly admitted and exclude same, I restrain myself from taking that path. Instead, I would place scant probative value or weight on Ex ‘C’ series due to the questions regarding its authenticity that I have raised supra. Accordingly I find as a fact that the claim of recalls of particular BMW vehicles that include the model bought by Plaintiff as alleged by Plaintiff was not satisfactorily proved by the Plaintiff who bears the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence on this issue.

As I have found the Defendant not liable in respect of negligence for the battery fire caused the vehicle of Plaintiff, can it also be that Defendant again is not liable for negligence for the damage caused Plaintiff’s vehicle due to the flood waters that engulfed Accra on the 3rd of June, 2015.

legal opinion on force majeure,"For Plaintiff to be entitled to his claim for negligence he must prove that, one that Defendant owed a duty, two there has been a breach of that duty, three, that there is causation and four that harm has been occasioned Plaintiff as a result of the breach of the duty. Duty of care is the primary requirement for a successful claim in negligence. For if there is no duty the failure to take reasonable care would not give rise to liability. The leading judicial test for a duty of care in England was found in the judgments of CAPARO INDUSTRIES PLC v DICKMAN \[1990\] AC 605; in which the House of Lords set out the following three-part test: Harm must be a ""reasonably foreseeable"" result of the Defendant's conduct; A relationship of ""proximity"" must exist between the Defendant and the Plaintiff; It must be ""fair, just and reasonable"" to impose liability. See also the following cases DONOGUE v STEVENSON \[1932\] AC 562; CHAPMAN v HEARSE \[1961\] 106 CLR 112.

And authenticity is a precondition precedent to admissibility of a writing. Section 136 of the Evidence Act, NRCD 323. See also the case of JUXON-SMITH v KLM DUTCH AIRLINES \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 438; where the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal to exclude four vital documents admitted by the trial Judge as the precondition necessary for their admissibility had been violated, thus sinning against section 136 of NRCD 323. Rather than rule that Ex ‘C’ was wrongly admitted and exclude same, I restrain myself from taking that path. Instead, I would place scant probative value or weight on Ex ‘C’ series due to the questions regarding its authenticity that I have raised supra. Accordingly I find as a fact that the claim of recalls of particular BMW vehicles that include the model bought by Plaintiff as alleged by Plaintiff was not satisfactorily proved by the Plaintiff who bears the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence on this issue.

This second valuation at the instance of Plaintiff could be said to be self-serving. The attempt at settlement before court and even in the course of trial was totally without prejudice and could not be said to bind the Defendant.
